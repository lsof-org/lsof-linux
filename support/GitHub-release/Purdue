Hi Vic,

One more request. Ken would like a copy of the email from Gerry. If for any reason you aren’t 
comfortable sending it to me, please contact Ken directly (765-494-1063, sandel@purdue.edu).

If this last piece of information is satisfactory to Ken, I expect to get his approval.

Thanks for your cooperation throughout this process.

Best,
Joe

Joe,

I sent e-mail to Gerry McCartney and in his answer he
says he has no objection.

Hi Vic,

Thanks for the extra detail. I think it would put Ken’s mind at ease if you have Gerry’s blessing. Let me 
know if you’ll reach out to him.

Best,
Joe

Joe,

I have had no communication with ITaP about the move to GitHub.
The extent of their involvement with lsof has been minimal – the
Visiting Scholar appointment and the maintenance of a distribution
system.

I know Gerry McCartney well.  Would it be helpful if I contacted
him about the GitHub move?

Hi Vic,

Ken Sandel, Senior IP Officer, just got back to me. He wants to know if the leadership of ITaP supports 
the contribution to Github. Please let me know. If you have any communication to this effect that you 
can forward to me, it would be helpful.

Best,
