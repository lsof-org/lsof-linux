No objection at all Vic,  and thank you for so many years of valuable service to the community.   

From one my senior people: “Lsof is one of the most amazing UNIX tools that retired PUCC 
wizard Vic wrote and still supports. Github is a much better answer than running a server in 
ITaP for it.”

Best wishes,   Gerry-

Subject: retiring lsof

Gerry,

Since I retired from ITaP in 2003, I have received support from ITaP
to continue distributing lsof, the open source UNIX tool that I developed
at PUCC and released in 1994.  That support extends to a Visiting
Scholar appointment and a Sun Solaris system, lsof.itap.purdue.edu
from which lsof is distributed.

I am nearing 80 in age and it is time for me to end my support before
circumstances do it for me.  I announced that intention to the lsof –l
mailing list (lsof-l@lists.purdue.edu) and several readers replied that
they would like to continue support by moving lsof to the GitHub
open source development platform (https://github.com/).

Because the lsof source code contains a Purdue Research Foundation
copyright, I have been discussing the release with Joseph R. Kasper
(JRKasper@prf.org) in Purdue’s Office of Technology Commercialization.
Joe is supportive of the move, but asks if I have discussed it with anyone
in ITaP.  Only Greg Veldman (gv@purdue.edu) , who has provided
support for lsof.itap, has been aware of the GitHub request.
I have been remiss in not contacting you about this.  Please excuse my
omission and let me know if you have any objection to the release of
lsof to GitHub.

Regards,

Vic Abell
